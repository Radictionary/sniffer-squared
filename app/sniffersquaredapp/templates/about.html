    <p>Sniffer Squared is a network sniffer detection platform that allows you to scan your network for network
        sniffers.</p>
    <p>Network sniffers are tools that can be used to intercept and analyze network traffic. They can be used for
        legitimate purposes, such as network monitoring, or for malicious purposes, such as eavesdropping on
        sensitive
        information.</p><br>
    <p>Sniffer Squared can help you detect network sniffers on your network and take action to protect your data.

        <span class="font-normal ml-4 text-lg">
            <span class="underline">What it does:</span> ARP spoofing, also known as ARP poisoning or ARP cache poisoning, is a technique used by malicious actors to intercept, modify, or redirect network traffic flowing between two devices in a local area network (LAN). This is done by editing the table to have a MAC address pointing to where the attacker wants it to so that they can get packets sent.
